objective
URL Blocker is an application that blocks URLs opened in a new tab according to a user-defined blacklist. This blacklist is not imported from a website, but entered manually by the user. URL Blocker does not collect any data for marketing purposes and does not share user blacklist content. It is a simple tool that closes URLs when it is in the blacklist.

activeTab 
This permission is required to access the user's active tabs. URL Blocker uses this permission in a limited way to detect the opening of tabs that should be blocked. This closes these tabs.

tabs 
The "tabs" permission is used to find the IDs of tabs blacklisted by the user. This permission is essential to close these tabs.

storage
The "storage" permission is required to store URLs to be blocked. This allows URL Blocker to detect tabs blacklisted by the user.
